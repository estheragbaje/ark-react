# Ark UI Avatar — Styled with Vanilla CSS

This project demonstrates how to style the `Avatar` component from Ark UI using Vanilla CSS.
We take full advantage of Ark UI's headless structure and data-part attributes to build a clean, scalable, and flexible Avatar component, without using any CSS-in-JS or external styling libraries.

## What This Project Covers

- How to render the Ark UI Avatar component

- How to target each component part (root, image, fallback)

- Styling with data-scope and data-part attributes

- "Thinking in recipes" with plain CSS

- Implementing base styles, size variants, shape variants, and visual variants
